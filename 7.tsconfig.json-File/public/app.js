//In this lesson we will learn how we can use TypeScript in a better way:
//Primarily we need to create two folders: public- It contains static files or compiled JS file and another one is src- It contains TypeScript file
//Afterward we will initialize TypeScript with this command: tsc --init (We need to run this command in a folder that contains public and src folder)
//A tsconfig.json file will be generated
//We need to uncomment and write ./src on rootDir and ./public in ourDir as i have written in ts.config file
//Afterward craete a file in src folder with .ts extension and run the follwing command in after opening terminal: 
//tsc
//It will comile the typescript file and generate a JS file in public folder 
//If we have written some code in TypeScript that will be compiled in JS file and we can that JS file code with this command after going in public command in terminal: node <JS filename>.js
